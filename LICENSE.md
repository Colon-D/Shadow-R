Most resources this game uses are from official Sonic games.
Shadow and Rouge are modifications I made to Xinus' [Prototype model for Sonic](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/sonic-r-hacking.18490/page-14#post-932621).

Anything else, anything I have made, is under the [WTFPL-69.420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean-clayton/WTFPL-69.420/master/WTFPL-69.420.txt) license.
So, that should be all code, shaders included.
Omega and Doom's Eye had their models completely made by me, but their texture's
are modifications of that from Sonic games.
Level geometry (not textures) is mostly all by me: The door frames are not by me, neither are the big jungle roots.
Some texture's like `goal.png`, the minimaps, shitty menus, are made by me, but for 99% of textures they are not by me.
Umm. I don't think there is much else...
